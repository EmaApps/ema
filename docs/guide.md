# Guide

After having familiarized yourself with Ema by following the [earlier section](getting-started.md), you are now ready to dive deep to learning how to achieving specific things.

* [Defining your model](guide/model.md) -- [Define your site model such that it supports hot reload]{.item-intro}
* [Working with routes](guide/routes.md) -- [Unless you site has a single page (`index.html`), you will need to manage a set of routes]{.item-intro}
* [Rendering HTML](guide/render.md) -- [You could use plain strings to build HTML, or use templates, or use one of the delightful Haskell DSLs]{.item-intro}

Helpers,

* [Tailwind + Blaze](guide/tailwind.md) -- [We recommend--but not mandate--Tailwind for CSS and blaze-html as HTML DSL]{.item-intro}
* [Working with files](guide/filesystem.md) -- [Ema's hot reload works with your files too]{.item-intro}
* [Converting Markdown](guide/markdown.md) -- [Ema doesn't dictate anything about content or layout, so this section just contains pointers]{.item-intro}
